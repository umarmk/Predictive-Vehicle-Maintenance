# Predictive Vehicle Maintenance System

A comprehensive web-based predictive vehicle maintenance system using advanced machine learning and a modern frontend. The system predicts key maintenance issues (Engine Failure, Brake Failure, Battery Failure, Low Tire Pressure, and Maintenance/Service Requirements) using sensor datasets.

```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/umarmk/Predictive-Vehicle-Maintenance.git
   cd Predictive-Vehicle-Maintenance
   ```

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Run the preprocessing script:
     ```bash
     python notebooks/data_preprocessing.py
     ```
   - Or use the provided Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration.

3. **Project Phases:**
   - Phase 1: Data Preparation & EDA (see notebooks/)
   - Phase 2: Model development (to be added)
   - Further phases: Web integration, deployment, etc.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn (see notebooks for details)
